Scene 1: The Comic Book Store Confrontation
INT. DOWNTOWN COMIC BOOK STORE - AFTERNOON

The store is a cozy haven, walls lined with vibrant comic book covers and action figures. JERRY (32, comic enthusiast) and MARCUS (30, tech geek) are standing in the narrow aisle between shelves packed with Marvel comics. Their expressions are intense, the air between them charged with the electricity of a brewing storm.

JERRY
(frustrated, waving an Iron Man comic)
Look, Marcus, I'm telling you, Tony Stark's character arc is the best in the Marvel Universe! He's got depth, growth, and redemption. It's a masterpiece of storytelling!

MARCUS
(scoffing, rolling his eyes)
Depth? Growth? Please. Tony Stark is just a glorified poster boy for flashy gadgets and unchecked ego. Spider-Man's the one who actually represents real growth and heroism.

Jerry's grip tightens on the comic book, his knuckles whitening. A few customers glance their way, sensing the tension.

JERRY
(voice rising)
Unchecked ego? Tony literally sacrificed everything to save the universe. How can you not see the heroism in that?

MARCUS
(crossing his arms, defiant)
Because it's always about the grand gesture with Stark, isn't it? Real heroism is in the day-to-day, the small stuff that Peter Parker deals with. Stark's just... he's just too much.

The argument escalates. Sentences are half-finished, voices raised, and neither friend is willing to budge. A comic book is accidentally knocked to the floor, the sound loud in the sudden silence that follows their heated exchange.

Scene 2: The Coffee Shop Resolution
INT. QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD COFFEE SHOP - EVENING

The coffee shop is dimly lit, a stark contrast to the bright comic store. Jerry and Marcus sit opposite each other at a small table near the back, their coffees untouched, the air thick with the recent memory of their quarrel.

Jerry looks out the window, his anger dissipated, replaced by a quiet pensiveness. Marcus fidgets with a napkin, the annoyance in his eyes giving way to a hint of regret.

JERRY
(softly)
I didn't mean to get so heated, man. Iron Man's just... he's been my hero since I was a kid.

MARCUS
(sighing)
I know, I know. And I get it, I do. I guess I've always related more to Spider-Man. His struggles, his normalcy... it spoke to me, you know?

A beat of silence passes as they both sip their coffee, the mood softening as the caffeine starts to settle.

JERRY
(looking at Marcus)
But that's the beauty of these stories, isn't it? They hit everyone differently. Like, your Spidey is my Iron Man.

MARCUS
(chuckles)
Yeah, I suppose you're right. We can't all have the same favorite Avenger, or it'd be pretty boring talks at the comic store, huh?

Jerry nods, a small smile playing on his lips. They both pick up their comics, now sharing the table, and begin to leaf through them, a peaceful silence enveloping them.

JERRY
(quietly)
So, truce? Over coffee and comics?

MARCUS
(grinning)
Truce. And maybe... you can lend me some of your Iron Man issues? I might have missed something.

They laugh, the sound mingling with the soft jazz playing in the background. The quarrel over Iron Man is set aside, their friendship as resilient as the heroes they admire.
